I’m an Applied Mathematics & Statistics student at Purdue, focused on quantitative research and data analytics. I like turning messy real-world data into clean datasets, reliable pipelines, and decisions you can defend.

Recently, I built a **factor momentum backtesting project** in Python, covering data prep, portfolio construction, transaction costs, and evaluation.

Right now I’m working on an **AI syllabus policy analysis** project: collecting public syllabus PDFs, converting them to text, using LLM-assisted extraction to structure policy fields, and building a dataset to support model fine-tuning for more consistent extraction.

I’m actively looking for internships in **quant research**, **data analytics**, and **equity research**, where I can apply math, statistics, programming, and clear communication to real problems.

Beyond work, you’ll usually find me watching anime, playing badminton, or hiking and exploring outdoors.
